# Heart Failure Analysis and Prediction

According to WHO, every year 17.9M people die from heart disease and it is the number one cause of death globally. However, most of this death is preventable by maintaining a healthy lifestyle, having the right diet, and avoiding tobacco. This dataset contains information on the age, tobacco intake. blood pressure, diabetes, and other blood cell level information of patients which can be useful to make inferences and building a predictive model.

In this project, my goal is to analyze this dataset and get insights into the impacts of harmful traits. I shall also build a predictive model to detect heart failure early.

Dataset can be found here: [Heart Failure Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data?select=heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv)


In this project, at first, I explored through the dataset, checked for issues for potential *Dataset Cleanups*, ran *Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)* which gave me insights about the potential features, and later tried several machine learning models to find out which one works best. For machine learning algorithms, I tried *Logistic Regression*, *KNN*, *Random Forest*, and *Decision Tree*.

I spotted that *Logistic Regression* is the best for predicting early heart failure as It was giving me 80%+ accuracy.

It was originally developed using Google Collab. Here's the [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MW8oasAgLFFW0iD2qj6HMhaBaxrnp3dF?usp=sharing).
